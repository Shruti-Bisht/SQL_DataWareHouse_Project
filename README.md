# SQL_DataWareHouse_Project

Welcome to the SQL Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀

This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a modern data warehouse and analytics solution. It covers the complete workflow from data ingestion and transformation to building analytical models and generating business insights.
<br>
The project is designed to showcase practical data engineering and analytics concepts, following industry-standard practices for data modeling, ETL/ELT pipelines, and reporting.

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.<br>
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.<br>
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.<br>

# 🚀 Project Requirements
## Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.<br>

###Specifications
- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
